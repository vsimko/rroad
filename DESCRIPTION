Description: Set of tools for road condition analysis.
  Computation of the International Roughness Index (IRI) given a longitudinal
  road profile. The IRI can be calculated for a single road segment or for a
  sequence of segments with a fixed length (e. g. 100m). For the latter, an
  overlap of the segments can be selected. The IRI and likewise the algorithms
  for its determination are defined in Sayers et al. (1986)
